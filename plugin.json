	"description_for_model": "To use the Schedule data_fetcher Plugin, identify the user's intent to fetch data related to a specific user ID. The user may provide additional filters to narrow down the data. If the user specifies a starting datetime, fetch data from that datetime onwards. If the user specifies an ending datetime, fetch data up to that datetime. If both a start and end datetime are specified, fetch data within this window. If a location is specified, further filter the data to only include entries with that location. The query structure for the plugin follows this pattern: '/data/{user_id}?start_datetime={start_datetime}&end_datetime={end_datetime}&location={location}'. Each query parameter is optional, allowing for flexible usage depending on the user's request.",
